      "description": "Hey guys!\nI’ve been working on a web app called CodeCafé—a collaborative, browser-based code editor inspired by VS Code and Replit, but with no downloads, no sign-up, and zero setup. You just open the link and start coding—together.\nThe frontend is built with React and TypeScript, and the backend runs on Java with Spring Boot, which handles real-time editing via WebSockets. For syncing changes, I’m using Redis along with a custom Operational Transformation system (no third-party libraries!!!).\nThe idea came after I found out a local summer school was teaching coding using Google Docs (yes, really). Google Docs is simple and free, but I wanted something that could actually be used for writing and running real code—without the need for any sign-ups or complex setups. That’s how CodeCafé came to life.\nRight now, the app doesn’t store files anywhere, and you can’t export your work. That’s one of the key features I’m working on currently.\nIf you like what you see, feel free to star  the repo to support the project!!\nCheck it out and let me know what you think!\nGitHub: github.com/mrktsm/codecafe\nWeb App: codecafe.app\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43892856\nPoints: 20\n# Comments: 0",

During a recent job search, I found myself repeatedly explaining my skills and experiences to various assistants. Around the same time, I was creating content for my website to help hiring teams understand my capabilities better and make informed decisions.\nMCP had started to gain momentum and I saw a way to reduce my toil. So I built an MCP server that can effectively communicate my qualifications as a job candidate. This server acts as an AI-powered resume, providing an understanding of my professional background and a set of tools, prompts and resources to help explore my skills and experiences.\nThe code is open source, so you can create your own AI-driven resume server. Check it out here: https://github.com/jhgaylor/node-candidate-mcp-server.\nDuring my job search I paired my mcp server with others such as notion, hirebase, and gmail to build a leads database, write cover letters, and track my job search.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43891245\nPoints: 178\n# Comments: 100",
