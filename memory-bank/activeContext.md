# Active Development Context

## Current Focus

- Updating Memory Bank documentation following completion of major auth features.
- Preparing for next feature implementation or testing phase.

## Recent Decisions & Implementation Details

- **Completed Auth Flow:** Implemented Sign Up, Sign In, Password Change, and Profile (Name) Update features.
- **API Validation:** Introduced `zod` for input validation in API routes (`/api/auth/signup`, `/api/user`, `/api/user/password`).
- **Repository Updates:** Added `addUser`, `updateUserProfile`, `updateUserPassword` functions to `lib/db/repositories/users.ts`.
- **Client-Side Forms:** Built forms for Sign Up, Password Change, and Profile Update in respective pages (`app/auth/signup`, `app/settings`).
- **Session Update:** Implemented seamless session updates (for user name) using `useSession().update()` client-side and the `jwt` callback server-side in NextAuth configuration.
- **UI Updates:** Added Sign Up link to Sign In page, and Settings link to user dropdown in the Navbar.
- Used in-memory `Map` objects for data storage (`lib/db/repositories/`).
- Loaded initial seed data from `config/data.json` synchronously on server start.
- Implemented client-side data fetching using `swr` for News and User Settings pages.
- Configured NextAuth.js with Credentials provider and JWT session strategy.
- Set up `.env.local` for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL`.

## Implementation Priorities (Completed for this phase)

1. Authentication system (Sign In, Sign Up, Password Change, Profile Update, session management)
2. API routes (Auth, Public/Private News, User Profile/Password)
3. Public and private news feed pages (UI and data fetching - feed management only for private)
4. User settings page (UI and data fetching/updates)
5. Navbar updates (Auth state, Settings link)

## Next Steps / Future Considerations

1.  **Implement RSS Feed Display:** Fetch and display actual RSS content on the private news page (`app/news/private/page.tsx`). Requires adding an RSS parsing library.
2.  **Write Playwright Tests:** Develop end-to-end tests covering the implemented authentication, settings, and news management flows.
3.  **Refine UI/UX:** Review and enhance the user interface and experience across the application.
4.  **Data Persistence:** Evaluate if writing data back to JSON or using a simple DB is needed for longer workshop scenarios.

## Active Considerations

- Prioritizing features most useful for Playwright demonstration.
- Ensuring testability of all implemented features.
- Maintaining codebase clarity and organization.
