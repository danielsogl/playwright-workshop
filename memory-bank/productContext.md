# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Workshop facilitators need a realistic yet controlled application environment to demonstrate Playwright testing capabilities. Existing demos are often too simple or too complex, lacking specific features needed for comprehensive testing demonstrations.

## User Experience Goals

- Workshop participants should see practical testing scenarios
- Application should represent real-world complexity while remaining understandable
- Features should be designed to highlight specific Playwright capabilities
- Interface should be intuitive to minimize learning curve during workshop

## Key Use Cases

1. **Authentication testing** - Demonstrate form submission, validation, session management
2. **API testing** - Show request interception, mocking, and validation
3. **Public vs. private content** - Test authorization and conditional rendering
4. **Data manipulation** - Test form submissions and state changes
5. **Visual testing** - Provide visually distinct components for screenshot testing
